abstract: "Studentsâ€™ ability to effectively allocate time toward educational tasks and reduction of maladaptive behaviors such as procrastination are important predictors of successful educational outcomes. The Academic Time Management and Procrastination Measure (ATMPM) purports to measure the extent to which students engage in such behaviors; however, the psychometric properties of the ATMPM have only been explored with exploratory techniques. In addition, the extent to which measurement invariance is supported among first-generation college students (FGCS) and non-FGCS is unknown. The purpose of the present study was to (1) examine the factor structure of the ATMPM within a college population by employing confirmatory factor analysis and to (2) investigate measurement invariance through an application of multiple group confirmatory factor analysis (MGCFA). Results supported a three-factor solution (planning time, monitoring time, and procrastination), and invariance analyses supported full configural, metric, and scalar invariance."
