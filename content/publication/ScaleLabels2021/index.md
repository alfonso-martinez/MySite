abstract: "Rating scales (e.g., Likert scales) have become an indispensable tool in the social sciences
for measuring latent constructs. Despite their practicality, it is well known that rating
scales are sensitive to design choices made during the scale construction process. In the
present study, we investigate the effects of different scale labeling configurations on the
distributional characteristics and psychometric properties of rating scales by analyzing data
from two 7-point rating scales that were altered with respect to their scale labels.
Specifically, we investigate the differences in composite score means, variances, reliability,
factor structure, and measurement invariance (i.e., configural, metric, and scalar
invariance) of two scales that measure divergent constructs (life satisfaction life; academic
time management & procrastination). Results indicate that distributional characteristics of
rating scales are affected by differences in labeling configurations to varying degrees,
however the psychometric properties of the scales are not influenced by changes in labeling.
In particular, it was found that scalar invariance held indicating the scales, although
different with respect to scale labels, have similar factor structures, discrimination
parameters, and latent intercept parameters, irrespective of labeling configuration.
Implications and recommendations for scale developers and directions for future research
are discussed."
