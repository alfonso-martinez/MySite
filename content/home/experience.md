During the summer of 2018, I participated in a Research Experience for Undergraduate (REU) program in Sioux Center, Iowa. The program was funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and was primarily focused on characterizing and identifying physical and mental health outcomes of individuals living in Ukraine. This was achieved by exploring WMH-CIDI data collected by the World Health Organization (WHO). I worked on two independent projects, one of which resulted in a poster presentation at the Council for Undergraduate Research (CUR) Symposium in October 2018. The second project resulted in a poster presentation at the Western Psychological Association (WPA) in October 2020."""
