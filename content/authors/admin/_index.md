I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Psychological and Quantitative Foundations in the College of Education at the University of Iowa. My research interests include advanced latent variable modeling (structural equation models, diagnostic classification models, etc.), random and mixed effect modeling, Bayesian modeling & prediction, estimation theory, and issues related to missing data analysis.
