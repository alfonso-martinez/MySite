I am a fourth year PhD student and ACT Fellow in the Educational Measurement and Statistics program at the University of Iowa as well as a second year Masters student in the Statistics program. My research interests include advanced latent variable modeling (structural equation models, diagnostic classification models, etc.), Bayesian modeling & prediction, estimation theory, and issues surrounding missing data.
