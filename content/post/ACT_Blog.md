description: ACT invited me to write.

Earlier this month, ACT invited me to write a piece about my experiences as a first-generation college student. I discuss my research interests, my educational journey, and advice for high school students and other first-generation college students. Here is the link to the article: https://equityinlearning.act.org/equity-in-action/guest-blog-dont-be-afraid-to-ask-questions/. A very big thank you to ACT for allowing me to share my experiences!
